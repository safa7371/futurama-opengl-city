FINAL PROJECT: FUTURAMA

Sasha Farhat
CSCI4229 Fall 2021

Many parts of this project was borrowed from previous assignments in this class. This include basic shapes such as cubes and cylinders and cone. I borrowed texture formatting from assignment 6. I borrowed lighting from homework 5. I borrowed perspective (first person), from my assignment 4.

The program was built in MAC OS. I was able to makefile by running command:
gcc -Wall -Wno-deprecated-declarations -o final final.c -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL


I am really proud of how this project turned out. I put many hours into researching, programming and executing this project. Creating this scene took me approximately 40+ hours to do.
That being said these are my major points of recognition I would like you take a closer look on:
- creating the windows primitively on the apartment buildings.
- The engine of the space ship was made by playing around with the values of the curved cylinder function to create this star like shape to it. 
- having the space cars and space ship moving over time. (tried to have them be as irregular as possible within the scope of time of the project).
- texturing the cylinder skyscrapers
